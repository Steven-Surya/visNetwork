# Interactive Network Visualization

<img src="visNetwork1.png" width="600" height="400">

In this project I use `visNetwork` package for interactive network visualization. 
This package use piping, similar to `tidygraph`.
This package allows us to create a visualization that can be modified, moved, rotated, etc. after the visualization has been rendered.
